								<h1>Welcome to Street Juke!</h1>
								<p>Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the following club rules and guidelines.</p>

								<h4 style="color: white;">Probation Period:</h2>
								<p>Upon your inclusion in our group chat, you will enter a probationary phase lasting 30 days. During this period, your level of activity within the group and your compatibility with our members will be assessed. We encourage you to engage with fellow members and establish new connections during this time.</p>

								<h4 style="color: white;">Participation Requirements:</h2>
								<p>It is expected that you attend a minimum of two local meetups each month and participate in at least one major event every six months. If personal circumstances require you to be absent for an extended period of time, please inform an admin. Failure to maintain engagement may lead to removal from the group.</p>

								<h4 style="color: white;">Affiliation:</h2>
								<p>Members are affiliated with Street Juke exclusively and may not display banners from other car clubs.</p>

								<h4 style="color: white;">Membership Privileges:</h2>
								<p>Following the one-month probationary period, you will become eligible for a Street Juke banner, which you are expected to display on your vehicle for the duration of your membership. A Street Juke T-Shirt wil also be available to purchase at that time.</p>

								<h4 style="color: white;">Vehicle Presentation:</h2>
								<p>It is essential to maintain your car in a presentable condition at all times while displaying the Street Juke banner. Baseline requirements include Coilovers/Lowering Springs/Air Suspension and Aftermarket Wheels.</p>

								<h4 style="color: white;">Conflict Resolution:</h2>
								<p>In the interest of preserving a drama-free environment, please do not hesitate to reach out to one of the admins with any crew-related issues that may arise.</p>

								<h4 style="color: white;">Social Media Engagement:</h2>
								<p>Be sure to add '@streetjuke' to your Instagram bio, use '#streetjuke' hashtags, and tag '@streetjuke' in car-related posts. Support fellow members by reposting their car-related content on your Instagram stories and commenting on their posts.</p>

								<h4 style="color: white;">Mutual Support:</h2>
								<p>As a team, we prioritize mutual support among members. This may involve assisting fellow members in the event of vehicle breakdowns or other unforeseen circumstances.</p>

								<h4 style="color: white;">Safe Driving Practices:</h2>
								<p>While driving together to various destinations, we emphasize safe and considerate driving. Our group prioritizes cruising rather than competitive driving. Please be vigilant and accommodating of your fellow members, allowing them to merge if necessary. Our commitment to safety precludes any accidents or harm resulting from avoidable circumstances.</p>

								<h4 style="color: white;">Driving Regulations:</h2>
								<p>Engaging in burnouts, reckless driving, drifting, or vehicle stunts at public events while displaying our banner is strictly prohibited. Such activities are only permissible at designated events that explicitly permit them, such as the US Drift Circuit, among others.</p>

								<h4 style="color: white;">Liability Concerns:</h2>
								<p>Purchasing or providing alcohol or illegal substances to a minor may result in the revocation of your membership. Such actions pose significant liability risks, which could jeopardize the reputation of Street Juke as a business and community.</p>

								<h4 style="color: white;">Confidentiality:</h2>
								<p>Sharing confidential information about our crew with external parties is strictly forbidden and may result in removal from the crew.</p>

								<h4 style="color: white;">Vehicle Transfers:</h2>
								<p>When selling or trading your vehicle, please ensure the prompt removal of the Street Juke banner.</p>
									
								<br>
								<p>Participation in our crew is a privilege, and we reserve the right to enforce our rules in the interest of a positive and enjoyable experience for all members.
								Thank you for your cooperation, and we look forward to the journey together as part of Street Juke.</p>
