								<p>
									Welcome to Street Juke! Glad to see a new face in the club.
									Please take the time to read these rules and guidelines as a new member.
								</p>
								<p>
									These are the following requirements to be a part of Street Juke:
									<ul>
										<li>Once you are added to the group chat, your probation period begins. For the next 30 days, we will be monitoring your activeness and overall vibe with our group. During this time, get a feel for our current members and try to develop new friendships with fellow members. We are looking forward to having you as an official member. Be active as much as possible during this month to our events/hangs. </li>
										<br>
										<li>You must be active. If we don't see or hear anything from you past a month, we will automatically void your membership and you will be removed. If you are going to be inactive for a period of time, let an admin know.</li>
										<br>
										<li>As a member, you must attend at least 2 local meets per month and at least 1 major show every 6 months.</li>
										<br>
										<li>Continue progression with your car.</li>
										<br>
										<li>Rep only one crew.</li>
										<br>
										<li>Your car banner is available to be made after your month probation period, if you are still approved by admins to remain in Street Juke. You must rep the banner as long as you are a part of crew.</li>
										<br>
										<li>Keep your car at a presentable state at all times when bannered.</li>
										<br>
										<li>Keep drama away from the crew. If you need to talk to someone or need advice, don't hesitate to ask the admins for help.</li>
										<br>
										<li>Add @streetjuke to your bio on instagram and also tag #streetjuke in car posts. (After your month probation period is up and you have remained a member of the crew.)</li>
										<br>
										<li>Support one another, especially if anyone breaks down and we're able to help. We are a team and a family.</li>
										<br>
										<li>Need a crew shirt after your month probation. Once the shirt is acquired, you have the right to help keep our events calm by telling people to chill if they aren't obeying carmeet/event rules.</li>
										<br>
										<li>Repost other members car posts on stories and comment on posts. This helps with network exposure and instagram database scores. Support one another.</li>
										<br>
										<li>When mobbing out together to destinations, for the safety of everyone, we do not have to be gunning it everywhere. We cruise, its not a competition. Be courteous to your fellow members, we are a team. Anticipate the unexpected. If you see your team member running out of road, allow them to get in front of you. We care about safety and we do not need to be in any accidents, or lose a friend due to something that could have been avoided.</li>
										<br>
										<li>Remove the banner if you are trading or selling your car.</li>
										<br>
										<li>The crew is a privilege and we are not afraid to kick people if we have to, so please for everyone's peace of mind, just follow the rules in place so we can all enjoy our time together and be on the same page.</li>
										<br>
										<li>If any member is buying or gets caught buying alcohol or any illegal substance for a minor, they will most likely get their membership revoked. It’s a huge liability, especially knowing that the Street Juke name is a business and we don’t need any situation that might jeopardize the crew and platform.</li>
										<br>
										<li>No member should be performing any burnouts or any reckless driving, including drifting and/or stunts involving your vehicle at public events while bannered up. If caught with proof, you will be banned from the crew. (Only allowed at designated events that allow such performances such as US Drift circuit, ect.) </li>
										<br>
										<li>Sharing confidential crew information with outside sources is strictly prohibited, and is grounds for removal from the crew.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<p>
									Minimum car requirements
									<ul>
										<li>Coilovers/Lowering Springs/Air Suspension</li>
										<li>Aftermarket Wheels</li>
										<li>Decent overall appearance at all times</li>
									</ul>
