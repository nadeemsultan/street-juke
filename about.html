								<h2 style="color: white;">What is Street Juke?</h2>
								<p>
									Streetjuke is a car club housed in West Palm Beach, Florida. We are a group of friends, partners, and family who all share an immense passion for cars, and the enthusiast culture.
									Streetjuke has been building and refining a platform for all individuals from countless backgrounds to come to a place where we can all meet likeminded people who share the same passion. 
									Our motto is "Built To Inspire". Through our growing platform and devotion to the car culture, we strive to build our cars in a way  that illustrates what’s possible to those who’ve always wanted to be a part of this community.
									Our goal is inspire as many as possible to chase their dreams in the car world, or whatever they may be. Doing so through the arduous process of building these machines is a great example of how hard work can pay off, and thoroughly enjoyed in a close knit group of people sharing the same passion. 
									As children, each of us had personal idols; whether it was a father figure, a superhero, or the protagonist in a racing action movie. For us, it just so happens we all wanted to have our very own versions of the cars we idolized in those movies; chomping at the bit to be old enough to start our own projects.
									Now that we are here, we want to make a difference in this community. We don’t want to only show the cars we’ve put blood, sweat, and tears into; but also influence the community in a positive manner so that we can all continue to grow as individuals. 
								</p>

								<h2 style="color:white">How was Street Juke made?</h2>
								<p>
									Streetjuke was initially formed based on a video game from 2005 called Need for Speed Underground 2.
									We developed a car crew online by playing a game type called team freeze, which is a game of 2v2 freeze tag.
									There was a glitch in the game that allowed us to play online and free roam the entire map. We would mod our cars to handle well but also have a lot of power when coming out of the turns.
									As the team who was running from the taggers, we would swerve quick down a street as if we were going to turn but actually go the opposite way. In doing so, we would "juke" the opponents, giving us an advantage that let us get farther away from the taggers.
									This is how we came up with the name "Streetjuke". We became well known in the online community of Need for Speed. By how it got so big on just a simple video game as i was a kid... I said to myself damn! I'd love to start this thing in real life once I get old enough and actually make it into something big and known.
									I developed a passion for cars over the years as i got older, and once I reached high school and got my car modded, I got a few of my closest friends and told them the idea, and thats how it popped off back in 2009.
									I always kept Streetjuke very small and private because back then I was such a introvert and always kept to my small circle. Around 2016-2017 is when my life changed due to certain events that happened.
									I then eventually turned my life around for the better. I became someone who was always trying to give back in some way and also bring others to the passion of cars.
									As years went by, we grew and grew and kept staying consistent with our builds, as well as our weekly meets and attendance. Eventually we ended up growing bigger than the other competing weekly hosts to now being one of the most popular street car clubs in West Palm Beach.
									We don't support recklessness, street takeovers, or acts of any illegal activity as we are only dedicating our time to these meets and shows for people all around to share their passions and connect with like minded individuals.
									Every single person who's lives changed for good is a positive for us here at Streetjuke. We strive to impact each enthusiast one at a time. As years go and we continue to build, we hope to surpass our city and expand far enough to host shows in other areas as we keep developing our network.
