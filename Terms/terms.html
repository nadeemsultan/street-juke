                                    	StreetJuke Member: 
This letter (The "Agreement") summarizes your understanding of the agreement that was enlisted to you on the following month after being an official accepted member of StreetJuke. These following points below are to be understood and agreed upon after your acceptance to the agreement; Please read the following below:
<p>
As I a member of this car club, I agree as follows:
<p>
1.Agreement:
It is my understanding as a member of Street Juke that being a member is a privilege and not a requirement. This car club is required a membership of $25.00 a month taken out automatically from your account as a subscription fee for being apart of the club. Every month moving forward is non-refundable at any cost. The funds are to benefit the club as a whole and to have funding to be able to cover the expenses required to run the club, and allow members to have perks. If you decide to leave the club at any time or get terminated for a specific reasoning by not following the rules or causing problems for the club as a whole; there is no refunds of any amounts of months payed previously. Paying the Membership fee is a requirement we require to be apart of our club. if you do not agree to these terms then unfortunately this club isnt for you.
<p>
2. Term:
The term of this agreement will commence as of the 1st day of the following month you apply and are accepted as a member and will continue in effect until either you decide to leave the club or get terminated for not following crew rules or causing damages to the club as a whole.
<p>
3. Force Majeure:
Neither of us will be liable to the other for any loss, damage, or default occasioned by striken civil disorder, governmental decree or regulations, acts of god or any other force majeure. 
<p>
4. Club Rules:
These are the following requirements to be apart of StreetJuke:
<ul>
	<li>Membership fee of 25$ a month auto payed every first of the month (Many benefits to this)</li>

	<li>Rep only one crew</li>
	<li>Car Banner is available to be made after your month probation period if still approved by admins for you to remain in SJ. Must rep as long as you are apart of crew.
